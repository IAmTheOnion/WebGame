Very simple webgame 

My old one is a fishing fanatic. Half the apartment with rods the worst. On average, once a month someone steps on a hook or anchor lying on the ground and you have to pull out in the hospital because they have burrs at the end. In my 22 years of life I have already had such a procedure 10 times. A week ago I went for some random tests is a woman from the reception as soon as she saw me she ordered the shoe to pull off xD because she thought that again the hook in the leg.
